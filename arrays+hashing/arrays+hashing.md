# Arrays & Hashing 

## **Arrays**

### Intro notes from Neetcode course 

- Data structures are stored in RAM. 
- Arrays are always continuous when they are stored in the RAM - nothing is stored between them. 
- Each numeric value in an array takes up 4 bytes within the RAM. ASCII characters take up 1 byte each. 


### Static Arrays
- An array is a continuous block of data
- two most common operations for sata structures are **Reading** and **Writing** the data
- static arrays have fixed sizes


### Dynamic Arrays
- this is the default in Python and JS
- there is a dynamic "pointer" which identifies the end of the array

### Stacks
- can be implemented using dynamic arrays

## **Hashing**
- sets are just a set of value whereas maps are a set of keys mapped to a different value
- 3 main operations for when you have a map:
1. insert
2. remove
3. search 
- these all run in constant time - O(1)
- hashmaps **cannot** contain duplicates
